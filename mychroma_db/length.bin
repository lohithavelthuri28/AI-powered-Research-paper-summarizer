invalid type: string "5) Cook’s Theorem\nStatement:SAT (Boolean Satisfiability) is NP‑complete.\\ Equivalently: SAT ∈ P iff P = NP .\nWhy it’s important:\nFirst NP‑complete problem – SAT became the benchmark to prove other problems NP‑complete\nvia reductions.\nPolynomial transformation – Any NP problem can be transformed into SAT in polynomial time\nfor i = 1 to n:\noice({1..n})\n
